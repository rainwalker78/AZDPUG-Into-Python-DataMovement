# AZDPUG-Into-Python-DataMovement

Here are the slides and code samples from the i8ntroduction to data movement talk given to the Arizona Dat Platform users group on 2025-02-12.

The python files are numbered in the order I went over them. There are two SQL files that can be used to manage the Sql Database. The pdf file is the slideshow, inclduding the notes which cover some of the talking points.
